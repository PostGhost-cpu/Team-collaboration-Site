### How the fee calculator works (summary)
* Each course checkbox uses a value attribute for price. Typical values used in this project:
* Six-month course: 1500
* Six-week course: 750

+ When the user applies, the script sums the values of checked courses.
+ The discount is chosen by the number of selected courses.
+ The final fee shown reflects subtotal minus discount.
